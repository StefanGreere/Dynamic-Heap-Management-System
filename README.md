# Dynamic-Heap-Management-System
Dynamic Heap Management System (DHMS): C implementation of a custom Segregated Free List (SFL) memory allocator. It simulates OS heap management, using Doubly-Linked Lists for fast allocation and implementing address-ordered lists for contiguous memory checks (READ/WRITE).
